## Owlery

Owlery is a set of REST web services, built on the [Spray](http://spray.io) toolkit, which allow querying of an OWL reasoner containing a configured set of ontologies, via HTTP.

It will also provide a web service front-end for [Owlet](https://github.com/phenoscape/owlet), which can be used as a remote SERVICE in a [SPARQL federated query](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/).
